# EURECOM Squash Club

Squash is an indoor racket sport, if you have ever enjoyed any racket sport, it's quite easy to have fun while playing this sport. And even though you've never touched any racket sport before, after one session you can easily have fun by just giving your best and running everywhere 

#### Practice sessions
<i class="fa-solid fa-location-dot"></i> <b style="color: grey;">Location:</b> 155 Bellevue Avenue, Antibes. (Near Antibes big Carrefour)

You can take A bus (directly from  EURECOM or not) and stop at Olympie and walk from there, it is barely 10 mins of walk.  

<i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-days"></i> <b style="color: grey;">Schedule:</b> Thursday from 2pm to 5pm  

Some of us are playing other days at the evening, contact us for further information) any motivated people is gladly welcome !

#### Objectives

Have fun together, release any pent-up frustration by smashing balls on the walls (yeah that's one heck of an advantage beacuse squash is played in a closed court üòÅ).  
At the same time it's a very physical but rewarding sports with plenty of energy spent chasing the ball, especially when our supervisor has decided to make you run üòâ
