# EUREClimb

Hello fellow climbers, EUREClimb is a group of climbers gathering every week to go indoor climbing (i.e climbing without a rope) in one of the places of the region.<br>
Whether you already climbed or not, have already done a lot of sports or not, come join us ! Climbing is the most beginner friendly sport !

#### Practice sessions

Prices per session will range from 9 to 15 euros.<br>
Transportation is provided by members with a car. The departure is usually from EURECOM and the return trip will drop you off at your desired location.


<i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-days"></i> <b style="color: grey;">Schedule:</b> Tuesday from 7pm to 9/10pm

If you want to climb any other day, don't hesitate asking for a session in the WhatsApp group, we would be very happy climbing with you.

#### Objectives

Having as much fun as possible and sending as many boulders as we can ! But beware, although climbing is quite physical no matter your level, it is also very rewarding and thus very addictive...


#### Equipment

Light sport clothes, and climbing shoes if you have (which are not hiking shoes). Otherwise, all the gyms can rent you shoes.

#### Supervisor 
The supervisor of the club is [Henri Carnot](mailto:<carnot@eurecom.fr>). 
Please do not hesitate to contact him for any information.
