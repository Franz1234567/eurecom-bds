â€” Football  
â€” Volleyball    
â€” Tennis    
â€” Running

Because some students finished their stay at EURECOM ðŸ˜”, many clubs are now missing a supervisor, so if you're interested in filling that role, please reach out to [Guillaume Ung](<mailto:ung@eurecom.fr>) <i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i>, the responsible for clubs or directly at : bds@eurecom.fr        
And of course, if you would like to create a new club for a new sport, feel free to reach out to [Guillaume Ung](<mailto:ung@eurecom.fr>) <i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i>.
