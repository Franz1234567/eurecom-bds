    <article class="container svelte-gfnm07"><p>Truly it was a great journey, and in it I met with many, whom to know was to
  love; but whom never could I see again; for life has not space enough; and
  each must do his duty to the security and well-being of the Redoubt. Yet, for
  all that I have set down, we travelled much, always; but there were so many
  millions, and so few years.
</p>
<p>Atticus said to Jem one day, “I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard,
  but I know you’ll go after birds. Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can
  hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.” That was the only
  time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss
  Maudie about it. “Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one
  thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens,
  don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out
  for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.
</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I
  am.
</p>
<p>We believe that we can change the things around us in accordance with our
  desires—we believe it because otherwise we can see no favourable outcome. We
  do not think of the outcome which generally comes to pass and is also
  favourable: we do not succeed in changing things in accordance with our
  desires, but gradually our desires change. The situation that we hoped to
  change because it was intolerable becomes unimportant to us. We have failed to
  surmount the obstacle, as we were absolutely determined to do, but life has
  taken us round it, led us beyond it, and then if we turn round to gaze into
  the distance of the past, we can barely see it, so imperceptible has it
  become.
</p>
<p>The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are
  felt with the heart.

<p>Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It’s hot in the summer and cold in the winter.
  It’s round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you’ve got a hundred
  years here. There’s only one rule that I know of, babies-“God damn it, you’ve
  got to be kind.
